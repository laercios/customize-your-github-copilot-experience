## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Hangman Game

#### Description
Build a Hangman-style word-guessing game where the player guesses letters to reveal a hidden word.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select a word from a predefined list
- Accept single-letter guesses from the player
- Reveal progress as underscores and letters (e.g., _ a _ _ m a n)
- Track and display incorrect guesses remaining
- Avoid penalizing the player for repeated correct guesses
- End with a win or lose message and show the correct word

### 🛠️ Optional Extensions

#### Description
Add features to improve the game experience.

#### Suggestions

- Load words from an external file
- Add difficulty levels (by word length or attempts)
- Keep a high-score or attempts counter
- Add ASCII-art hangman or a small GUI using `tkinter`
